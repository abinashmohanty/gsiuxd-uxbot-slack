GSIUXD *Slack Bot* `Version 1.2`

## Chat Bot for GSIUXD Slack Community

This Slack chatbot will greet onboarding users especially for our GSIUXD UX Slack community. The name of our Slackbot would be called just *GSIUXD*. Currently, this Slackbot is under testing. And we will add more features over time.


## Updates `03 2017`
1. Multi-team support.
2. Name of the chatbot called *UXbot*
3. More features to compile...

## Updates `12 2016`

1. This chat bot will only work inside GSIUXD Slack Team via _direct message_, _direct mention_, or _mention_ based events for now, and of course. 
2. We don't want to clutter our other channel feeds with such testings. 
3. We’ll make it global over time so that others can install this bot app into multiple slack teams. 
4. This bot will be functioning via local server. 

###### How to use?

1. Sign in to [GSIUXD Slack Community](https://getstartedinuxdesign.slack.com/) using desktop, mobile browser, or app.
2. If you’re new user, get an [invite to join](https://gsiuxd.herokuapp.com/). 
3. Once signed in, chat with our chat bot `Ramu Kaka` by using `@ramukaka` by opening a direction message via slack. When you click on the direction messages, you will see a screen like this. Just type out `ramukaka` and the bot will appear upfront.
